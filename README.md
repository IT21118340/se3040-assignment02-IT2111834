# An Interactive dashboard to visualize data from NASA APIs

## Introduction

This react application consume data from NASA's public APIs available at NASA API portal and allows users visualize and interpret data in a user friendly manner. This project aims to showcase my skills in front-end development, integration with external APIs, testing and application deployment.

This guide will walk you through setting up, building, and running the application locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have **Node.js** and **Vite** build tool installed on your system. We recommend using Node.js version 14.x or newer. You can check your Node.js version by running `node -v` in your terminal.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IT21118340/se3040-assignment02-IT2111834.git
   cd se3040-assignment02-IT2111834
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Building the Application

To build the application for production, run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm run build
```
This command compiles the application for production to the `dist` folder, optimizing the build for performance.

## Running the Application Locally

To start the development server and see your application in action, execute:
```
npm run dev
```
This command starts the Vite development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5713` in your web browser. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the page.
